#Bubble Sort Algorithm
----------------------

Bubble Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity. In Bubble Sort algorithm, the elements are sorted by iterating through the whole array and swapping two consecutive elements if they are not in order untill the swap during the iteration becomes zero. At this point, the array becomes sorted. The worst case for bubble sort algorithm to complete is to go through n^2 iterations.
